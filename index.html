      <p class="text">Our first big project of the year was our choose your own adventure webpage. This was designed to teach us how to format a webpage, get familiar with displaying text, and use links to progress through a webpage.</p>

      <p class="text">As an additional challenge, I decided to add a tracker to keep you progress saved and a map to display the paths you have already discovered so you don't have to click through the whole book.</p>

      <p class="text">Overall I really enjoyed this project. It really got me involved in the material anc got me excited to learn new things, like css grid and visited links. I used these links in the gold underlined headers in this project.</p>

      <p class="text">Hi! My name is Devon Morrison. This semester's Web Design class was my first time being exposed to the world of coding, and I love it.</p>
      <p class="text">I am 16 years old and a Junior in high school. Some of my favorite things to do are race sailboats, animate my drawings, and make kick-ass halloween costumes (scroll to see below).</p>

      </div>
      <p class="text">Throughout the semester I have been honing my skills and challenging myself to find multiple solutions to each problem I encounter. With every project I completed, my sphere of knowledge grew and I was able to utilize more complex techniques to improve my quality of work.</p>
      <p class="text">Overall, I really enjoyed this class and look forward to continuing my programming journey.</p>
      <p class="text">P.S. Hey! Check it out, I made my first scrolling text box!</p>

      <p class="text">Another one of our projects was the imitation project. The purpose of this was to make a copy of an existing magazine or other printed media using only html and css.</p>

      </div>
      <p class="text">In addition to the copying, we also had to make a version that can scale with the width of the webpage that it is opened on, this was also done with css.</p>
      <div class="imageBox">

      <p class="text">This project was the first time we made a webpage that changes in real time. It is a very useful skillset that I was able to apply in almost every project I've done since, including this project.</p>
